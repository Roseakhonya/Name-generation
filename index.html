        <h2>Name generator</h2>
        <p>This is a site that is basically designed to help one know the day they were born and assign them a Ghanian Akan name 
       depending on their gender and the say of the week they were born. It provides you a form where you need to key in your details 
       including your name, gender, date, month and year of birth. The system will then automatically display the day of the week that
       you were born and the Akan Ghanian name.</p>
